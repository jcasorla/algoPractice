Good morning. A lot of people have been asking me about interview prep strategies as well as how to get better at algorithms. Thought this message I gave to someone might be beneficial to at least understand my strategy of learning DS&A. Best of luck to you guys. I’m hearing so many great things. It’s been really encouraging for me to become a better engineer

Message:
"So the advice that was passed to me is to not spend more than 20 min on a challenge without making progress. After 20 min, go look at the solution.

My twist on the that is that it is beneficial to “understand” as many solutions as possible. The reason I say this is that by understanding the benefits and drawbacks of each solution, I start to see patterns where I can detect optimizations I can do.

Carrying this to today while doing coding competitions, I literally come up with a brute force approach and think to myself, “I’ve seen this solution before and they optimized it by doing this”

Hope this helps you create your own strategy that works for you and you land a job with your dream company. Keep going ??"
